"""

	we define an S-number to be a natural number, n. that is a perfect square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of n into 2 or more numbers then adding the numbers

	for example 81 is an S-Number because sqr81 = 8 + 1
	6724 is an S-Number sqr6724 = 6 + 72 + 4
	8281 is an S-Number sqr8281 = 8 + 2 + 81
	9801 is an S-Number sqr9801 = 98 + 0 + 1

	further we define T(N) to be the sum of all S numbers n <= N. you are given t(10^4) = 41333

	find T(10^12)
